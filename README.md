## Contributions
- **Reformulate counting problem:** We propose S-DCNet, which transforms open-set counting into a closed-set problem via Spatial Divide-and-Conquer;
- **Simple and effective:** S-DCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50 and UCF-QNRF),  a vehicle counting dataset (TRANCOS) and a plant counting dataset (MTC). Compared to the previous best methods, S-DCNet brings a 20.2% relative improvement on the ShanghaiTech Part_B, 20.9% on the UCF-QNRF, 22.5% on the TRANCOS and 15.1% on the MTC.

## Code will come soon!
